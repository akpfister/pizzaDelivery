# pizzaDelivery

Pizza Delivery is a Python script you can use to make an order from Domino's without a web browser. I got the idea from a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxu6GlDleqA&t=403s) and used the [pizzapi python wrapper](https://github.com/gamagori/pizzapi).

## What You Need

Use pip to install necessary packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I recommend using virtualenv to create a virtual environment for the project.

```bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 order_pizza.py
```
